configurations they can run depending on configurations they can run up to 2 gahz of dual core i7 speed with up to 2 gahz of dual core i7 speed with up to 2 gahz of dual core i7 speed with Intel turbo boosting they can get as Intel turbo boosting they can get as Intel turbo boosting they can get as high as 3.2 GHz you can configure with high as 3.2 GHz you can configure with high as 3.2 GHz you can configure with up to 8 gigs of memory and that's now up to 8 gigs of memory and that's now up to 8 gigs of memory and that's now faster memory 1600 GHz faster memory 1600 GHz faster memory 1600 GHz memory and the integrated Graphics that memory and the integrated Graphics that memory and the integrated Graphics that they run on are dramatically faster up they run on are dramatically faster up

Technologies and be willing to newest Technologies and be willing to discard the old Legacy thing so you discard the old Legacy thing so you discard the old Legacy thing so you could make something unlike any other could make something unlike any other could make something unlike any other notebook that's been made to notebook that's been made to notebook that's been made to date so would you like to see the Next date so would you like to see the Next date so would you like to see the Next Generation MacBook Generation MacBook Generation MacBook Pro well let's show it to you Pro well let's show it to you Pro well let's show it to you [Applause] now so the Next Generation MacBook Pro now so the Next Generation MacBook Pro is the most beautiful computer we have is the most beautiful computer we have is the most beautiful computer we have ever made well the first thing you're ever made well the first thing you're ever made well the first thing you're going to notice from the front it's going to notice from the front it's going to notice from the front it's dominated by an amazing magnificent new dominated by an amazing magnificent new dominated by an amazing magnificent new display there's never been been a display there's never been been a display there's never been been a notebook that is this gorgeous but notebook that is this gorgeous but notebook that is this gorgeous but really if you want to be shocked let's really if you want to be shocked let's really if you want to be shocked let's turn it around to its side and see what turn it around to its side and see what turn it around to its side and see what it looks like from the side view view now I know it's tough to see from the now I know it's tough to see from the now I know it's tough to see from the audience you the challenge show you audience you the challenge show you audience you the challenge show you something so thin and light and small something so thin and light and small something so thin and light and small from so far away but just to give you a from so far away but just to give you a from so far away but just to give you a little context here's my finger next to little context here's my finger next to little context here's my finger next to it right it right it right it's thinner than my finger I mean even it's thinner than my finger I mean even it's thinner than my finger I mean even even with it's closed it is because that even with it's closed it is because that even with it's closed it is because that display is so radically thin it is a display is so radically thin it is a display is so radically thin it is a true breakthrough in engineering and true breakthrough in engineering and true breakthrough in engineering and there has never been a notebook this there has never been a notebook this there has never been a notebook this thin this light and this powerful for thin this light and this powerful for thin this light and this powerful for professional use let's bring it back professional use let's bring it back professional use let's bring it back around to the front don't worry we're going to tell front don't worry we're going to tell you all about it in just a you all about it in just a you all about it in just a minute but we just have to enjoy for a minute but we just have to enjoy for a minute but we just have to enjoy for a second how incredible this second how incredible this second how incredible this is so close it up for is so close it up for is so close it up for now let me go up to the slides and tell now let me go up to the slides and tell now let me go up to the slides and tell you some more about this incredible you some more about this incredible you some more about this incredible product so the new Next Generation product so the new Next Generation product so the new Next Generation MacBook Pro is 0.71 in thin that is MacBook Pro is 0.71 in thin that is MacBook Pro is 0.71 in thin that is remarkable putting it next to the remarkable putting it next to the remarkable putting it next to the existing current generation MacBook Pro existing current generation MacBook Pro existing current generation MacBook Pro you see the difference it's a quarter you see the difference it's a quarter you see the difference it's a quarter thinner but it's a dramatic amount in thinner but it's a dramatic amount in thinner but it's a dramatic amount in fact let me bring the MacBook Air next fact let me bring the MacBook Air next fact let me bring the MacBook Air next to it and you see it's about as thin as to it and you see it's about as thin as to it and you see it's about as thin as a MacBook Air that is incredible and its a MacBook Air that is incredible and its a MacBook Air that is incredible and its weight it weighs just 4.46 PBS under 4 weight it weighs just 4.46 PBS under 4 weight it weighs just 4.46 PBS under 4 and a half pounds it is the lightest Pro and a half pounds it is the lightest Pro and a half pounds it is the lightest Pro notebook that we have ever made even notebook that we have ever made even notebook that we have ever made even just lighter than the 13-in MacBook Pro just lighter than the 13-in MacBook Pro just lighter than the 13-in MacBook Pro today but probably the most amazing today but probably the most amazing today but probably the most amazing thing about it is this gorgeous display thing about it is this gorgeous display thing about it is this gorgeous display that it's built with it is a that it's built with it is a that it's built with it is a breakthrough and display breakthrough and display breakthrough and display engineering yes it is a retina display which which means the pixels the pixels on this means the pixels the pixels on this means the pixels the pixels on this display are so small that from a normal display are so small that from a normal display are so small that from a normal working distance your retina cannot working distance your retina cannot working distance your retina cannot discern those individual pixels and to discern those individual pixels and to discern those individual pixels and to use it is absolutely use it is absolutely use it is absolutely stunning it's 15.4 in stunning it's 15.4 in stunning it's 15.4 in across but it's pixel density are you across but it's pixel density are you across but it's pixel density are you are you all sitting down this is really are you all sitting down this is really are you all sitting down this is really exciting it is 2,880 pixels by 1,800 exciting it is 2,880 pixels by 1,800 exciting it is 2,880 pixels by 1,800 that's four times the number of pixels that's four times the number of pixels that's four times the number of pixels in the previous generation MacBook Pro in the previous generation MacBook Pro in the previous generation MacBook Pro display their density is 220 pixels per display their density is 220 pixels per display their density is 220 pixels per inch and I know some of you were really inch and I know some of you were really inch and I know some of you were really smart out there and have already done smart out there and have already done smart out there and have already done the math it's 5,1 184,000 pixels that is the math it's 5,1 184,000 pixels that is the math it's 5,1 184,000 pixels that is the world's highest resolution notebook the world's highest resolution notebook the world's highest resolution notebook display and it yes and it's not only amazing because yes and it's not only amazing because the number of pixels in it but the the number of pixels in it but the the number of pixels in it but the quality of this display is the best we quality of this display is the best we quality of this display is the best we have ever made it has higher contrast have ever made it has higher contrast have ever made it has higher contrast ratios deeper blacks it has a higher ratios deeper blacks it has a higher ratios deeper blacks it has a higher angle of view with IPS technology and angle of view with IPS technology and angle of view with IPS technology and best of all you get the benefit of the best of all you get the benefit of the best of all you get the benefit of the glossy display with the rich color but glossy display with the rich color but glossy display with the rich color but we've been able to reduce the glare and we've been able to reduce the glare and we've been able to reduce the glare and Reflection by up to Reflection by up to Reflection by up to 75% makes it a joy to work 75% makes it a joy to work 75% makes it a joy to work on now it ships with os10 Lion but lion on now it ships with os10 Lion but lion on now it ships with os10 Lion but lion has been updated to take full advantage has been
