windows open your documents no more windows open your documents aren't open you usually have to pick a aren't open you usually have to pick a aren't open you usually have to pick a template why can't applications get you template why can't applications get you template why can't applications get you back to work quickly well that's what back to work quickly well that's what back to work quickly well that's what resume does now when you launch an resume does now when you launch an resume does now when you launch an application in L in it brings you right application in L in it brings you right application in L in it brings you right back to where you were when you quit it back to where you were when you quit it back to where you were when you quit it remembers what documents you were

rather than lot like time machine but rather than being about your whole system it's about being about your whole system it's about being about your whole system it's about that one document you're

do is ask Craig versions what I like to do is ask Craig to come back up and give another demo to come back up and give another demo to come back up and give another demo showing how this all works together showing how this all works together showing how this all works together Craig again all right well let's let's start again all right well let's let's start with Launchpad you see it's an icon with Launchpad you see it's an icon with Launchpad you see it's an icon right here on my dock I click and I get right here on my dock I click and I get right here on my dock I click and I get an

development developers some great new development developers some great new development tools including significant enhancements tools including significant enhancements tools including significant enhancements to xcode instruments in the to xcode instruments in the to xcode instruments in the simulator even core image we brought simulator even core image we brought simulator even core image we brought over the powerful core image Frameworks over the powerful core image Frameworks over the powerful core image Frameworks from Macos 10 to from Macos 10 to from Macos 10 to iOS this allows developers to do complex iOS this allows developers to do complex iOS this allows developers to do complex image operations like Redeye reduction image operations like Redeye reduction image operations like Redeye reduction face detection right from within their face detection right from within their face detection right from within their apps so you're asking yourself when are apps so you're asking yourself when are apps so you're asking yourself when are you getting you getting you getting it and the answer is we are giving a it and the answer is we are giving a it and the answer is we are giving a developer seed to you you developer seed to you you developer seed to you you [Applause] today this is going to be great for the today this is going to be great for the conference

far far far good well I'll try not to blow good well I'll try not to blow good well I'll try not to blow it so I get to talk about iCloud we've it so I get to talk about iCloud we've it so I get to talk about iCloud we've been working on this for some time now been working on this for some time now been working on this for some time now and we're really excited excited about and we're really excited excited about and we're really excited excited about it um about 10 years ago we had one of it um about 10 years ago we had one of it um about 10 years ago we had one of our most important insights and that was our most important insights and that was our most important insights and that was that the PC was going to become the that the PC was going to become the that the PC was going to become the digital hub for your Digital digital hub for your Digital digital hub for your Digital Life what did that mean well it meant Life what did that mean well it meant Life what did that mean well it meant that that's where you were going to put that that's where you were going to put that that's where you were going to put your digital photos where else were you your digital photos where else were you your digital photos where else were you going to put going to put going to put them your digital video off your digital them your digital video off your digital them your digital video off your digital camcorder and of course your music right camcorder and of course your music right camcorder and of course your music right you were going to acquire it in the you were going to acquire it in the you were going to acquire it in the device or potentially on your device or potentially on your device or potentially on your Mac uh and you were going to basically Mac uh and you were going to basically Mac uh and you were going to basically syn it to the mac and everything was syn it to the mac and everything was syn it to the mac and everything was going to work fine and it did for the going to work fine and it did for the going to work fine and it did for the better part of 10 years but it's broken better part of 10 years but it's broken better part of 10 years but it's broken down in the last few down in the last few down in the last few years why well because the devices have years why well because the devices have years why well because the devices have changed they now all have music they now changed they now all have music they now changed they now all have music they now all have photos they now all have video all have photos they now all have video all have photos they now all have video and so if I acquire a song I buy it and so if I acquire a song I buy it and so if I acquire a song I buy it right on my right on my right on my iPhone I want to get that to my other iPhone I want to get that to my other iPhone I want to get that to my other devices right I pick up my iPad and it devices right I pick up my iPad and it devices right I pick up my iPad and it doesn't have that song on it so I have doesn't have that song on it so I have doesn't have that song on it so I have to sync my iPhone to my Mac then I have to sync my iPhone to my Mac then I have to sync my iPhone to my Mac then I have to sync my other devices to the Mac to to sync my other devices to the Mac to to sync my other devices to the Mac to get that song but then they've deposited get that song but then they've deposited get that song but then they've deposited some photos on the Mac so I have to sync some photos on the Mac so I have to sync some photos on the Mac so I have to sync the iPhone again with the Mac to get the iPhone again with the Mac to get the iPhone again with the Mac to get those photos and keeping these devices those photos and keeping these devices those photos and keeping these devices in sync is driving us us crazy crazy so we've got a great solution for this so we've got a great solution for this so we've got a great solution for this problem and we think this solution is problem and we think this solution is problem and we think this solution is our next big Insight which is we're our next big Insight which is we're our next big Insight which is we're going to demote the PC and the Mac to going to demote the PC and the Mac to going to demote the PC and the Mac to just be a device just like an iPhone an just be a device just like an iPhone an just be a device just like an iPhone an iPad or an iPod touch and we're going to iPad or an iPod touch and we're going to iPad or an iPod touch and we're going to move the digital Hub the center of your move the digital Hub the center of your move the digital Hub the center of your Digital Life into the Digital Life into the Digital Life into the cloud because all these new devices have cloud because all these new devices have cloud because all these new devices have communications built into them they can communications built into them they can communications built into them they can all talk to the cloud whenever they all talk to the cloud whenever they all talk to the cloud whenever they want and so want and so want and so now if I get something on my iPhone it now if I get something on my iPhone it now if I get something on my iPhone it sent up to the cloud immediately let's sent up to the cloud immediately let's sent up to the cloud immediately let's say I take some pictures with it those say I take some pictures with it those say I take some pictures with it those pictures are in the cloud and they are pictures are in the cloud and they are pictures are in the cloud and they are now pushed down to my devices completely now pushed down to my devices completely now pushed down to my devices completely automatically and now everything's in automatically and now everything's in automatically and now everything's in sync with me not even having to think sync with me not even having to think sync with me not even having to think about it I don't even have to take the about it I don't even have to take the about it I don't even have to take the devices out of my pocket I don't have to devices out of my pocket I don't have to devices out of my pocket I don't have to be near my Mac or be near my Mac or be near my Mac or PC now some people think the cloud is PC now some people think the cloud is PC now some people think the cloud is just a hard dis in the sky right and you just a hard dis in the sky right and you just a hard dis in the sky right and you take a bunch of stuff and you put it in take a bunch of stuff and you put it in take a bunch of stuff and you put it in your Dropbox or your Idis or whatever your Dropbox or your Idis or whatever your Dropbox or your Idis or whatever and it transfers it up to the cloud and and it transfers it up to the cloud and and it transfers it up to the cloud and stores it and then you drag whatever you stores it and then you drag whatever you stores it and then you drag whatever you want back out on your other devices we want back out on your other devices we want back out on your other devices we think it's way more than that and we think it's way more than that and we think it's way more than that and we call it iCloud now iCloud stores your call it iCloud now iCloud stores your call it iCloud now iCloud stores your content in the content in the content in the cloud and

you can all your purchase history now you can all your purchase history now you can see it on all your devices even if the see it on all your devices even if the see it on all your devices even if the app's not there and we've added this button here which and we've added this button here which is download from the cloud and if you is download from the cloud and if you is download from the cloud and if you want that app on that device you just want that app on that device you just want that app on that device you just push that button and that app is push that button and that app is push that button and that app is automatically sent to that device right automatically sent to that device right automatically sent to that device right and there's no extra charge no extra and there's no extra charge no extra and there's no extra charge no extra charge now we've done that for your charge now we've done that for your charge now we've done that for your purchase history what about for devices purchase history what about for devices purchase history what about for devices you buy in the future well for devices you buy in the future well for devices you buy in the future well for devices when you buy them in the future you want when you buy them in the future you want when you buy them in the future you want to buy Yelp to buy Yelp to buy Yelp say the cloud downloads it to all your say the cloud downloads it to all your say the cloud downloads it to all your devices again at no extra charge all automatically so that's what we're doing automatically so that's what we're doing with the App with the App with the App Store iBooks same thing you've got your Store iBooks same thing you've got your Store iBooks same thing you've got your purchase history of all the books you purchase history of all the books you purchase history of all the books you bought on any device you want to get it bought on any device you want to get it bought on any device you want to get it on your iPhone say just push the button on your iPhone say just push the button on your iPhone say just push the button it downloads to that device when you buy it downloads to that device when you buy it downloads to that device when you buy a new iBook let's say you want to a new iBook let's say you want to a new iBook let's say you want to buy this book here the wave it downloads buy this book here the wave it downloads buy this book here the wave it downloads it to all your devices it to all your devices it to all your devices now and if you're reading it on one now and if you're reading it on one now and if you're reading it on one device let's say you're reading it on device let's say you're reading it on device let's say you're reading it on your iPad and you've just got a run you your iPad and you've just got a run you your iPad and you've just got a run you get to a page you bookmark that page get to a page you bookmark that page get to a page you bookmark that page that bookmark is sent up to the cloud that bookmark is sent up to the cloud that bookmark is sent up to the cloud and stored and again push to all your and stored and again push to all your and stored and again push to all your other devices so maybe you can read other devices so maybe you can read other devices so maybe you can read another the rest of the chapter as an another the rest of the chapter as an another the rest of the chapter as an example on the train to work it all just works and now backup we talked about works and now backup we talked about being PC free Scott talked about how you being PC free Scott talked about how you being PC free Scott talked about how you can wirelessly backup your devices daily can wirelessly backup your devices daily can wirelessly backup your devices daily to your PC or your Mac but let's do it to your PC or your Mac but let's do it to your PC or your Mac but let's do it to the cloud as well for those people to the cloud as well for those people to the cloud as well for those people that want to be completely PC free so that want to be completely PC free so that want to be completely PC free so we've added Wireless backup to the we've added Wireless backup to the we've added Wireless backup to the cloud and uh cloud and uh cloud and uh basically once basically once basically once daily we're going to back up a lot of daily we're going to back up a lot of daily we're going to back up a lot of your important contents to the cloud if your important contents to the cloud if your important contents to the cloud if you ever get a new phone or have to you ever get a new phone or have to you ever get a new phone or have to replace a phone you literally type in replace a phone you literally type in replace a phone you literally type in your Apple ID and password and your Apple ID and password and your Apple ID and password and everything will be loaded onto that everything will be loaded onto that everything will be loaded onto that phone automatically and phone automatically and phone automatically and wirelessly so so we automatically do daily backup so so we automatically do daily backup to iCloud over to iCloud over to iCloud over WiFi we back up your purchased music WiFi we back up your purchased music WiFi we back up your purchased music apps and apps and apps and books we back up your camera roll with books we back up your camera roll with books we back up your camera roll with your photos and videos we back up your your photos and videos we back up your your photos and videos we back up your device settings and we back up your app device settings and we back up your app device settings and we back up your app data all to the cloud so that is cloud so that is backup and those are three other apps backup and those are three other apps backup and those are three other apps that with that with that with iCloud but we couldn't stop iCloud but we couldn't stop iCloud but we couldn't stop there and so we have a final three apps there and so we have a final three apps there and so we have a final three apps that are amazing the most inventive part that are amazing the most inventive part that are amazing the most inventive part of iCloud I think and uh I'd love to of iCloud I think and uh I'd love to of iCloud I think and uh I'd love to tell you about tell you about tell you about them the first them the first them the first one is documents in the one is documents in the one is documents in the cloud so if I'm on my iPad and I create a Pages if I'm on my iPad and I create a Pages document right I create a Pages document document right I create a Pages document document right I create a Pages document and it automatically uploads it and and it automatically uploads it and and it automatically uploads it and stores it in the stores it in the stores it in the cloud When I close that document cloud When I close that document cloud When I close that document completely completely completely automatically and it then pushes it to automatically and it then pushes it to automatically and it then pushes it to all the devices that I have pages all the devices that I have pages all the devices that I have pages on so I can get the document between my on so I can get the document between my on so I can get the document between my devices devices devices and we have put that into Pages and we have put that into Pages and we have put that into Pages numbers and keynote as a matter of fact numbers and keynote as a matter of fact numbers and keynote as a matter of fact the versions We just released last week the versions We just released last week the versions We just released last week have this in there and to demonstrate what this is there and to demonstrate what this is like with ior I'd love to invite Roger like with ior I'd love to invite Roger like with ior I'd love to invite Roger Rosner who's our VP of ior up to give us Rosner who's our VP of ior up to give us Rosner who's our VP of ior up to give us a quick all right let's take a look at how I all right let's take a look at how I workor and iCloud will work together workor and iCloud will work together workor and iCloud will work together let's say you're working on a keynote let's say you're working on a keynote let's say you're working on a keynote presentation on your iPad making a presentation on your iPad making a presentation on your iPad making a beautiful presentation with all those beautiful presentation with all those beautiful presentation with all those awesome keynote graphic effects and awesome keynote graphic effects and awesome keynote graphic effects and animations but you're away from home you animations but you're away from home you animations but you're away from home you didn't bring your iPad with you and you didn't bring your iPad with you and you didn't bring your iPad with you and you run into somebody who wants to see your run into somebody who wants to see your run into somebody who wants to see your presentation well the good news is last presentation well the good news is last presentation well the good news is last week we shipped ior for iPhone and even week we shipped ior for iPhone and even week we shipped ior for iPhone and even better for anybody who bought an ey better for anybody who bought an ey better for anybody who bought an ey workor app for your iPad you can workor app for your iPad you can workor app for your iPad you can download that app for your iPhone at no download that app for your iPhone at no download that app for your iPhone at no additional additional additional charge so let's fire up keynote on this charge so let's fire up keynote on this charge so let's fire up keynote on this phone this is the first time we've run phone this is the first time we've run phone this is the first time we've run it here so it's going to say hi and then it here so it's going to say hi and then it here so it's going to say hi and then it's going to say do you want to use it's going to say do you want to use it's going to say do you want to use iCloud we say yes and immediately it iCloud we say yes and immediately it iCloud we say yes and immediately it sees all your keynote presentations that sees all your keynote presentations that sees all your keynote presentations that you've been working on in the cloud and you've been working on in the cloud and you've been working on in the cloud and starts to download them in the starts to download them in the starts to download them in the background to your background to your background to your iPhone so I'll open this one we were iPhone so I'll open this one we were iPhone so I'll open this one we were just looking at and as you can see it's just looking at and as you can see it's just looking at and as you can see it's all there it even remembered what slide all there it even remembered what slide all there it even remembered what slide we were looking at and if I want to I we were looking at and if I want to I we were looking at and if I want to I can just hit play play it right on my can just hit play play it right on my can just hit play play it right on my iPhone and I put exactly zero effort iPhone and I put exactly zero effort iPhone and I put exactly zero effort into getting that file over here pretty neat of course all the ey work apps use neat of course all the ey work apps use iCloud so let's take a look at iCloud so let's take a look at iCloud so let's take a look at pages and imagine you're out and you uh pages and imagine you're out and you uh pages and imagine you're out and you uh you're inspired to make some changes to you're inspired to make some changes to you're inspired to make some changes to a document you've been working on a document you've been working on a document you've been working on so I'm going to move this graphic over so I'm going to move this graphic over so I'm going to move this graphic over here maybe I just took a photograph that here maybe I just took a photograph that here maybe I just took a photograph that I think would be great to spruce up my I think would be great to spruce up my I think would be great to spruce up my cover page so I'll go to my camera roll cover page so I'll go to my camera roll cover page so I'll go to my camera roll insert my insert my insert my graphic use alignment guides to place it graphic use alignment guides to place it graphic use alignment guides to place it and I'm done and I I stick the phone in and I'm done and I I stick the phone in and I'm done and I I stick the phone in my pocket and I forget about it and uh my pocket and I forget about it and uh my pocket and I forget about it and uh in the background iCloud is grabbing all in the background iCloud is grabbing all in the background iCloud is grabbing all those changes and then immediately those changes and then immediately those changes and then immediately pushing them back down to my iPad so pushing them back down to my iPad so pushing them back down to my iPad so when I get home pick up the iPad fire up when I get home pick up the iPad fire up when I get home pick up the iPad fire up Pages you can see in the upper left my Pages you can see in the upper left my Pages you can see in the upper left my document thumbnails already been updated and there are all my edits updated and there are all my edits absolutely no effort on my part and that absolutely no effort on my part and that absolutely no effort on my part and that is how I work works with iCloud I think is how I work works with iCloud I think is how I work works with iCloud I think you're going to like it thank you thanks thanks Roger Roger Roger and documents in the cloud really and documents in the cloud really and documents in the cloud really completes our iOS document storage story completes our iOS document storage story completes our iOS document storage story too in other too in other too in other words a lot of us have been working for words a lot of us have been working for words a lot of us have been working for 10 years to get rid of the file system 10 years to get rid of the file system 10 years to get rid of the file system so the user didn't have to worry about so the user didn't have to worry about so the user didn't have to worry about it when you try to it when you try to it when you try to teach teach somebody how to use a Mac teach teach somebody how to use a Mac teach teach somebody how to use a Mac the easiest of all computers to use the easiest of all computers to use the easiest of all computers to use everything's going along fine until you everything's going along fine until you everything's going along fine until you hit the file system and then difficulty hit the file system and then difficulty hit the file system and then difficulty is staggering for most people so we've is staggering for most people so we've is staggering for most people so we've made it on the iOS devices to where you made it on the iOS devices to where you made it on the iOS devices to where you don't ever have to think about it the don't ever have to think about it the don't ever have to think about it the app manages the presentation of its own app manages the presentation of its own app manages the presentation of its own documents just like mail manages the documents just like mail manages the documents just like mail manages the presentation of its own presentation of its own presentation of its own messages but the piece that we weren't messages but the piece that we weren't messages but the piece that we weren't finished with was how do we move those finished with was how do we move those finished with was how do we move those documents around to different devices documents around to different devices documents around to different devices and docum in the cloud solves that and docum in the cloud solves that and docum in the cloud solves that problem for problem for problem for us apps can store documents in us apps can store documents in us apps can store documents in iCloud iCloud pushes those documents to iCloud iCloud pushes those documents to iCloud iCloud pushes those documents to a user's devices a user's devices a user's devices automatically the documents update on automatically the documents update on automatically the documents update on all devices when changed on any all devices when changed on any all devices when changed on any device and we are device and we are device and we are releasing API for all of you so you so it's really easy to tie your apps into it's really easy to tie your apps into it's really easy to tie your apps into icloud's storage icloud's storage icloud's storage system and again you can have complex system and again you can have complex system and again you can have complex documents apps like Pages or we've got documents apps like Pages or we've got documents apps like Pages or we've got another storage facility for key value another storage facility for key value another storage facility for key value data so as an example if you've got an data so as an example if you've got an data so as an example if you've got an app that just tracks stocks you can just app that just tracks stocks you can just app that just tracks stocks you can just update the key value Pairs and we'll update the key value Pairs and we'll update the key value Pairs and we'll store that in the cloud as store that in the cloud as store that in the cloud as well so documents and key value data well so documents and key value data well so documents and key value data Works across all iOS devices and Macs Works across all iOS devices and Macs Works across all iOS devices and Macs and PCs too so we think this is going to be too so we think this is going to be pretty big and that is documents in the cloud this next one is maybe my favorite cloud this next one is maybe my favorite one one one um and it's called Photo Stream um and it's called Photo Stream um and it's called Photo Stream and it's going to bring the cloud to and it's going to bring the cloud to and it's going to bring the cloud to photos how many times have we taken photos how many times have we taken photos how many times have we taken photos on our iPhone maybe of our kids photos on our iPhone maybe of our kids photos on our iPhone maybe of our kids in the in the in the afternoon and wanted when we got home to afternoon and wanted when we got home to afternoon and wanted when we got home to share them on an iPad and have to go share them on an iPad and have to go share them on an iPad and have to go through the process of moving them over through the process of moving them over through the process of moving them over wouldn't it be great if by the time I wouldn't it be great if by the time I wouldn't it be great if by the time I got home they were already there on the got home they were already there on the got home they were already there on the iPad well that's what photo stream's iPad well that's what photo stream's iPad well that's what photo stream's going to do for us across all of our going to do for us across all of our going to do for us across all of our devices so again I take photos on any devices so again I take photos on any devices so again I take photos on any device puts it in the camera device puts it in the camera device puts it in the camera roll that will be automatically uploaded roll that will be automatically uploaded roll that will be automatically uploaded to the cloud where it's stored and to the cloud where it's stored and to the cloud where it's stored and automatically downloaded to all my other automatically downloaded to all my other automatically downloaded to all my other devices including in this case a Mac and devices including in this case a Mac and devices including in this case a Mac and so I've got my photos on my I iPad just so I've got my photos on my I iPad just so I've got my photos on my I iPad just waiting for me when I get waiting for me when I get waiting for me when I get home now in addition I can import photos home now in addition I can import photos home now in addition I can import photos right into ioto as an example on the right into ioto as an example on the right into ioto as an example on the Mac it'll upload those to the cloud and Mac it'll upload those to the cloud and Mac it'll upload those to the cloud and do exactly the same thing with them by do exactly the same thing with them by do exactly the same thing with them by pushing them down to all my other pushing them down to all my other pushing them down to all my other devices so it's apps that I it's photos devices so it's apps that I it's photos devices so it's apps that I it's photos that I take or photos that I that I take or photos that I that I take or photos that I import and we've built this right into import and we've built this right into import and we've built this right into the apps I I hope you've seen that as the apps I I hope you've seen that as the apps I I hope you've seen that as we've gone through this we've built this we've gone through this we've built this we've gone through this we've built this right into the apps so there's nothing right into the apps so there's nothing right into the apps so there's nothing new to learn so photo stream on the new to learn so photo stream on the new to learn so photo stream on the iPad's photo app we built it right in iPad's photo app we built it right in iPad's photo app we built it right in right next to right next to right next to albums we have a button called photo albums we have a button called photo albums we have a button called photo stream you push it and you're looking at stream you push it and you're looking at stream you push it and you're looking at the photo stream it's that simple the photo stream it's that simple the photo stream it's that simple there's not a separate app that you have there's not a separate app that you have there's not a separate app that you have to go learn it's right there in your to go learn it's right there in your to go learn it's right there in your photos app it's right there in your photos app it's right there in your photos app it's right there in your photos app on your iPhone it's just photos app on your iPhone it's just photos app on your iPhone it's just right there with all your other right there with all your other right there with all your other albums There You Go photo stream on the Mac on the Mac we built it stream on the Mac on the Mac we built it right into ioto right into ioto right into ioto and so it's right there on the side your and so it's right there on the side your and so it's right there on the side your photo photo photo stream and on a PC they don't have a stream and on a PC they don't have a stream and on a PC they don't have a photos app so we use the pictures photos app so we use the pictures photos app so we use the pictures folder folder folder right in addition to that we've even right in addition to that we've even right in addition to that we've even built it built it built it in to Apple in to Apple in to Apple TV so Apple TV Apple TV talks directly over the TV Apple TV talks directly over the Internet directly to to the photo stream Internet directly to to the photo stream Internet directly to to the photo stream servers doesn't even go through your PC servers doesn't even go through your PC servers doesn't even go through your PC talks directly to the photo stream talks directly to the photo stream talks directly to the photo stream servers so you can watch the photos servers so you can watch the photos servers so you can watch the photos right on your Apple TV TV so one of the problems we faced was that so one of the problems we faced was that so one of the problems we faced was that we'll photos are large and we'll use up we'll photos are large and we'll use up we'll photos are large and we'll use up all the memory on your all the memory on your all the memory on your devices they're also large they'll devices they're also large they'll devices they're also large they'll consume vast amounts of storage in our consume vast amounts of storage in our consume vast amounts of storage in our server server server Farms so we've came up with a great Farms so we've came up with a great Farms so we've came up with a great scheme we're going to store photos on scheme we're going to store photos on scheme we're going to store photos on your devices we're going to store the your devices we're going to store the your devices we're going to store the last thousand last thousand last thousand photos right they'll store the last photos right they'll store the last photos right they'll store the last thousand and any photos you want to keep thousand and any photos you want to keep thousand and any photos you want to keep permanently just move them into an album permanently just move them into an album permanently just move them into an album and they'll stay forever but they'll be and they'll stay forever but they'll be and they'll stay forever but they'll be parading by you the last thousand parading by you the last thousand parading by you the last thousand photographs on your Mac or PC because we photographs on your Mac or PC because we photographs on your Mac or PC because we have more storage we'll store all of have more storage we'll store all of have more storage we'll store all of them you can get rid of them by just them you can get rid of them by just them you can get rid of them by just deleting them but we'll store all of deleting them but we'll store all of deleting them but we'll store all of them and on the server will storm for 30 them and on the server will storm for 30 them and on the server will storm for 30 days which is more than enough time for days which is more than enough time for days which is more than enough time for all your devices to connect and all your devices to connect and all your devices to connect and automatically download those automatically download those automatically download those photos so we think we've got a great photos so we think we've got a great photos so we think we've got a great system here that's going to move our system here that's going to move our system here that's going to move our photos around among all of our devices photos around among all of our devices photos around among all of our devices even Apple TV so that when I take a even Apple TV so that when I take a even Apple TV so that when I take a photo anywhere I can view it on all my photo anywhere I can view it on all my photo anywhere I can view it on all my other devices we think this is going to other devices we think this is going to other devices we think this is going to be really exciting to demonstrate this be really exciting to demonstrate this be really exciting to demonstrate this I've asked Eddie Q our VP of Internet I've asked Eddie Q our VP of Internet I've asked Eddie Q our VP of Internet services to come on up and give us a services to come on up and give us a services to come on up and give us a demo of photo stream thanks Steve stream thanks Steve yep so I want to take some photos to yep so I want to take some photos to yep so I want to take some photos to start with now I love cars and I happen start with now I love cars and I happen start with now I love cars and I happen to have brought one of my favorite ones to have brought one of my favorite ones to have brought one of my favorite ones with me here today and here it with me here today and here it with me here today and here it is and we're going to go to our my is and we're going to go to our my is and we're going to go to our my iPhone and launch the camera headlights and now these photos are on headlights and now these photos are on my iPhone but let's go look at my iPad now we've built Photo Stream right iPad now we've built Photo Stream right into the photos app so right next to into the photos app so right next to into the photos app so right next to albums is photo stream and there is the albums is photo stream and there is the albums is photo stream and there is the pictures I just took I didn't have to learn anything new at I didn't have to learn anything new at all and if I want to save them all and if I want to save them all and if I want to save them permanently on my permanently on my permanently on my iPad I can just select them and move iPad I can just select them and move iPad I can just select them and move them to an existing album or even create them to an existing album or even create them to an existing album or even create a new album that's it now these photos aren't album that's it now these photos aren't just on my iPad they're on all of my just on my iPad they're on all of my just on my iPad they're on all of my devices let's move over to the Mac where devices let's move over to the Mac where devices let's move over to the Mac where I've got I photo I've got I photo I've got I photo running and we've built again Photo running and we've built again Photo running and we've built again Photo Stream right in took so so now when I take a photo on took so so now when I take a photo on one of my devices they automatically one of my devices they automatically one of my devices they automatically appear on all of my devices without appear on all of my devices without appear on all of my devices without having to do anything at all it's that having to do anything at all it's that having to do anything at all it's that simple and that's Photo Stream thanks D that was thanks D that was great great great okay is that awesome awesome so photos you take or import upload to so photos you take or import upload to so photos you take or import upload to iCloud iCloud pushes them to all your iCloud iCloud pushes them to all your iCloud iCloud pushes them to all your devices works over Wi-Fi it's iCloud stores each photo for Wi-Fi it's iCloud stores each photo for 30 days which is plenty enough time for 30 days which is plenty enough time for 30 days which is plenty enough time for all the devices to be all the devices to be all the devices to be connected devices store the last connected devices store the last connected devices store the last thousand photos and again you can just thousand photos and again you can just thousand photos and again you can just drag them to an album they stay drag them to an album they stay drag them to an album they stay forever and mac and PC store all forever and mac and PC store all forever and mac and PC store all photos so we're really really pleased photos so we're really really pleased photos so we're really really pleased with photo stream we think you're going with photo stream we think you're going with photo stream we think you're going to like it a to like it a to like it a lot last but not lot last but not lot last but not least is iTunes in the cloud you know it's the same old you know it's the same old story right about I buy something on my iPhone right well and and it's not on my iPhone right well and and it's not on my other devices I grab my iPod and I go to other devices I grab my iPod and I go to other devices I grab my iPod and I go to listen to that song I bought yesterday listen to that song I bought yesterday listen to that song I bought yesterday on my

on one of my it so now when I buy a song on one of my devices it automatically downloads to devices it automatically downloads to devices it automatically downloads to all of my devices without having to sync all of my devices without having to sync all of my devices without having to sync or do any work at all and that's iTunes or do any work at all and that's iTunes or do any work at all and that's iTunes in the in the in the cloud thanks thank you very much isn't this thanks thank you very much isn't this awesome so music purchased from awesome so music purchased from awesome so music purchased from iTunes high quality 256 kilobits AAC and iTunes high quality 256 kilobits AAC and iTunes high quality 256 kilobits AAC and you can have up to 10 devices you can have up to 10 devices you can have up to 10 devices downloading your music to all of them downloading your music to all of them downloading your music to all of them every time you buy it on any every time you buy it on any every time you buy it on any device iTunes in the device iTunes in the device iTunes in the cloud so these nine apps constitute cloud so these nine apps constitute cloud so these nine apps constitute iCloud and they are iCloud and they are iCloud and they are all free we want we want every user to take free we want we want every user to take advantage of these and we know if we advantage of these and we know if we advantage of these and we know if we make them free that they'll they will make them free that they'll they will make them free that they'll they will and uh we want people to see what these and uh we want people to see what these and uh we want people to see what these devices can really do and what the soft devices can really do and what the soft devices can really do and what the soft software can really do so we're making software can really do so we're making software can really do so we're making it free and we're very excited about it free and we're very excited about it free and we're very excited about it so that's it so that's it so that's iCloud it stores your content and iCloud it stores your content and iCloud it stores your content and wirelessly pushes it to all your wirelessly pushes it to all your wirelessly pushes it to all your devices and it's integrated with your devices and it's integrated with your devices and it's integrated with your apps so everything happens apps so everything happens apps so everything happens automatically so a competitor that automatically so a competitor that automatically so a competitor that doesn't own the apps or doesn't have doesn't own the apps or doesn't have doesn't own the apps or doesn't have great developers to integrate with their great developers to integrate with their great developers to integrate with their apps they can never do this they can apps they can never do this they can apps they can never do this they can never make it so it just never make it so it just never make it so it just works and that's what we've done here so works and that's what we've done here so works and that's what we've done here so how do you get it well when you upgrade how do you get it well when you upgrade how do you get it well when you upgrade your phone or buy a new phone with iOS 5 your phone or buy a new phone with iOS 5 your phone or buy a new phone with iOS 5 on it all you have to do is type in your on it all you have to do is type in your on it all you have to do is type in your Apple ID and password and that's it and Apple ID and password and

make today and also today we're going to make today and also today we're going to make something available to end users which something available to end users which something available to end users which is the iTunes and the cloud portion and is the iTunes and the cloud portion and is the iTunes and the cloud portion and it runs on iOS it runs on iOS it runs on iOS 4.3 it'll run on all the supported 4.3 it'll run on all the supported 4.3 it'll run on all the supported platforms when we ship it this fall but platforms when we ship it this fall but platforms when we ship it this fall but today we're going to put it out for 4.3 today we're going to put it out for 4.3 today we're going to put it out for 4.3 as a beta and everyone can get their as a beta and everyone can get their as a beta and everyone can get their hands on it and run it on their existing hands on it and run it on their existing hands on it and run it on their existing uh existing iPhone 4S so we think this uh existing iPhone 4S so we think this uh existing iPhone 4S so we think this is going to be really exciting and of is going to be really exciting and of is going to be really exciting and of course we ship iCloud concurrent with course we ship iCloud concurrent with course we ship iCloud concurrent with shipping shipping shipping ios5 this ios5 this ios5 this fall so that is iCloud now there's one more now there's one more thing oh thing oh thing oh all a small thing it pertains to iTunes all a small thing it pertains to iTunes all a small thing it pertains to iTunes in the cloud as you recall iTunes in the in the cloud as you recall iTunes in the in the cloud as you recall iTunes in the cloud is just for the music that you've cloud is just for the music that you've cloud is just for the
